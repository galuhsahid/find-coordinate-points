## Find Corner Coordinates

I'm terrible at naming things I'm sorry. It's live [here](http://galuh.me/find-corner-coordinates).

**What does this tool do?**
It's a quick tool to collect northwest and southeast corner coordinates of a rectangle that covers a particular area on the map.

**Um ok how is this even useful?**
Well I initially built it for myself, because I need to collect these coordinates to be used with the [S2 Geometry Library](http://s2geometry.io/). You might find another use of this, who knows!

### Configuration
You just need to setup your [API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and [restrict your API key if needed](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key#key-restrictions).
